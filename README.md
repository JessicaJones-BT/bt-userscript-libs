# bt-userscript-libs

A collection of javascript libraries that can be @require'd in userscripts

This repo is meant to provide a publicly-accessible URL by which javascript libraries can be included in userscripts (e.g. Tampermonkey), maintaining internal control over the scripts to mitigate supply chain attacks/etc.
